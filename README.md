Stock Market Analysis for Tech Stocks
In this project, I am analysing data from the stock market for some technology stocks.

Questions answered:

What was the change in a stock's price over time?
What was the daily return average of a stock?
What was the moving average of various stocks?
What was the correlation between daily returns of different stocks?
How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
How can we attempt to predict future stock behaviour?
