# Stock Market Analysis for Tech Stocks

This project involves analyzing the stock market performance of major tech companies using various financial metrics and statistical methods. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and risk assessment. The main focus is on predicting future stock prices, assessing volatility, and estimating the Value at Risk (VaR) for each stock.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze the historical performance of tech stocks and forecast their future performance using Python. The analysis covers:
- Historical stock data analysis for tech companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, etc.
- Visualization of stock trends, returns, and volatility.
- Monte Carlo simulations for future stock price prediction.
- Value at Risk (VaR) estimation to understand investment risks.

## Technologies Used
- Python (version 3.10.0)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- yFinance (Yahoo Finance API)

## Data Description
The dataset comprises historical stock prices for several major tech companies, including:
- Open, high, low, close, and adjusted close prices
- Trading volume data

The data is fetched using the `yFinance` library, which pulls stock data directly from Yahoo Finance.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:
1. **Data Collection**: Using the `yFinance` library to pull stock data for companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, etc.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing stock prices, daily returns, and moving averages.
4. **Volatility Analysis**: Calculating daily stock returns and analyzing stock price volatility.
5. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Performing 10,000 simulations to predict future stock prices.
6. **Risk Assessment**: Estimating the Value at Risk (VaR) for different confidence levels.

## Analysis Summary
### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualized stock prices, trading volume, and daily returns for each tech company.
- Calculated moving averages to identify trends over time.

### Volatility Analysis
- Calculated daily returns and assessed the volatility for each stock.
- Created visualizations for rolling volatility to understand stock fluctuations.

### Monte Carlo Simulation
- Simulated 10,000 potential future stock prices based on historical volatility.
- Predicted future stock prices for a specified number of days.

### Value at Risk (VaR) Estimation
- Estimated the potential loss for an investment at a 99% confidence level using VaR.
- Visualized the final price distribution and marked the stock at risk.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-analysis-for-tech-stocks.git
   cd stock-market-analysis-for-tech-stocks
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Stock_Market_Analysis_for_Tech_Stocks.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each cell step by step.

## Results
- Google's stock exhibited a stable performance based on the simulations.
- Starting price: $622.05
- Mean final price after 10,000 simulations: $623.36
- VaR at a 99% confidence level indicated a risk of $18.38 for every stock.
